MA' "  Life feels so different since he came into this world."
MA' "  It used to feel so lonely. There wasn’t much to do around the house."
MA' "  Mostly just work and … oh! Taking pictures."
MA' "  I love to do that. All the pictures on our wall was taken by me.”
MA' "  And with Arell here now ... I have to be more organized."
MA' "  I remember writing down some lists ... but where did I put them?"
MA' "  There’s always so much to do—especially with taking care of Arell."
MA' "  That little note must be around here somewhere."
MA' "  Oh ... I’ve been so scatterbrained lately."
MA' "  Arell takes up all my energy—crying every other moment, keeping me on my toes."
MA' "  But it’s okay. For something this precious, I’d give everything I have."
MA' "  Maybe I left it near the kitchen ... let’s check there."
