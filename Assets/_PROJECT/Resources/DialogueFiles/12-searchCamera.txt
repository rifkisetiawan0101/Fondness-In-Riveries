MA' "  When I finished elementary school, I bought a camera with my own earnings."
MA' "  Where is that camera, anyway?"
MA' "  I should get it … I want to take pictures of Arell later."
MA' "  Every moment deserves to be captured!"
MA' "  Arell … I can’t wait to talk to him about photography when he’s older."
MA' "  I’m sure he’ll love it too."
